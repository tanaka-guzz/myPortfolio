                    <p>
                        The client had an ebay buisness selling repaired consoles and controllers as well as modded consoles. 
                        they wanted a cool website that had a futuristic cyberpunk look to make the modding of older consoles 
                        feel newer and premium. They website should increase sales of the clients buisness. the website will increase 
                        the business exposure while avoiding the ebay fees.<br><br>

                        The main audienc are middle aged gamers that dont mind spending more for a custome gaming 
                        expiriance..<br><br>
                            
                        The website will compete with websites such as scuff Gaming and clutch controlers that have a 
                        more sleek and modern look.<br><br>

                    <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                    <p>
                        After doing research and creating a specification and reqirments I use Figma inorder to 
                        prototype key pages of the website along with wireframing the design with pen and paper to 
                        test navigation, user interactions, and overall flow.<br><br>

                        This step helps identify usability issues early, refine design choices, and gather feedback before 
                        full development begins, ultimately saving time and resources.

                    <h3>Finalising design</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before implementing the design in code i then decide on a colour scheme with the client and create a 
                        simple logo. then assets such as logos and background elements are collected and created using 
                        illustrator.<br><br>

                        The assets are carefully placed on the layout to give life to the website. 
                        fonts are chosen for both style and readability.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        If the client has a social media presence we decide where to include it and how. in the case its 
                        in the footer of every page of the website.<br><br>

                        Forms the user will have to submit are designed to avoid and confusing and be easy to fill out increasing conversions.

                    <span>Managing Databases</span><br><br>

                    Django Managers are used to create databases. the advantages are :<br><br>

                    -encapsulation of logic allowing reuse of query logic allowing the whole database to be made quicker than using sql.
                    <br><br>
                    -improved code organisation by keeping model related logic inside the model rather than scattering it out through views making the code more maintainable.
                    <br><br>
                    -Cleaner queries
                    <br><br>
                    -separation of concerns e.g maintaining the separation of the store logic and the user and staff logic
                    <br><br>
                    -easy to extend and override default behaviour for advanced cases
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="section section6">

                    <p>
                        <span>Store page</span> <br><br>
                        Every online store should have well ordered navigation. using django models the user 
                        can filter games through the systems they belong to. each product has tags to indicate 
                        more info such as The type of modification done or the storage of the console as well as 
                        if its a custom design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span>product page</span> <br><br>
                        In order to store all the text for the products while leaving room to format it later dynamically 
                        the text is saved in the database using markdown language that can be used with django to essentially 
                        save something similar to html in the database and have it be rendered when delivered from the backend.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span>Login Page</span> <br><br>
                        The background for this page was custom made in illustrator in order to give a futuristic cyberpunk 
                        look. Django provides a simple was to create a login and authentication system that pre packed to be 
                        secure. There is also a pre built password recovery system that can use the buisness email to reset 
                        the password. The entire system can be customized to fit the branding of diffrent buisnesses.

                    <p>
                        <span>Register Page</span> <br><br>
                        djangos built in registration form provied client and server side validation. The client side validation 
                        is good because its much quicker than server side validation meaning the user dosnt get a delay when miss 
                        inputting info creating a better user expiriance. It also applies authentication such as https encryption 
                        making it an easy and safe solution.

                    <p>
                        <span>Basket Page</span> <br><br>
                        The basket page has good usability features such as changing the quantity of items and deleting 
                        them in-case a user changes their mind at the end so they stay on the page. There are 2 variations of 
                        the basket one that instantly updates the backend if the user is logged in and another cookie based 
                        solution for guest users.

                    <p>
                        <span>checkout page</span> <br><br>
                        The checkout page is simple to navigate providing good ux design. The Paypal api was used for 
                        purchases as Paypal is a trusted payment method and is widely used. The api also has a lot of 
                        documentation making it easy to implement. When a logged in user checks out they aren't required 
                        to enter the name and email address further improving the ux creating a stress free buying 
                        experience.
