                    <h3>What is nebula Mods</h3>
                    <p>
                        The client had an ebay buisness selling repaired consoles and controllers as well as modded consoles. 
                        they wanted a cool website that had a futuristic cyberpunk look to make the modding of older consoles 
                        feel newer and premium. They website should increase sales of the clients buisness. the website will increase 
                        the business exposure while avoiding the ebay fees.<br><br>

                        The main audienc are middle aged gamers that dont mind spending more for a custome gaming 
                        expiriance..<br><br>
                            
                        The website will compete with websites such as scuff Gaming and clutch controlers that have a 
                        more sleek and modern look.<br><br>

                    <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                    <p>
                        After doing research and creating a specification and reqirments I use Figma inorder to 
                        prototype key pages of the website along with wireframing the design with pen and paper to 
                        test navigation, user interactions, and overall flow.<br><br>

                        This step helps identify usability issues early, refine design choices, and gather feedback before 
                        full development begins, ultimately saving time and resources.

                    <h3>Finalising design</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before implementing the design in code i then decide on a colour scheme with the client and create a 
                        simple logo. then assets such as logos and background elements are collected and created using 
                        illustrator.<br><br>

                        The assets are carefully placed on the layout to give life to the website. 
                        fonts are chosen for both style and readability.<br><br>

                    </p>

                    <h3>Social Media and Forms</h3>
                    <p>
                        If the client has a social media presence we decide where to include it and how. in the case its 
                        in the footer of every page of the website.<br><br>

                        Forms the user will have to submit are designed to avoid and confusing and be easy to fill out increasing conversions.
